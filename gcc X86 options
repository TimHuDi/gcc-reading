1. GCC  have flags that allow you to tell them what kind of hardware you have. They are “-march” and “-mtune”.
   (Ref->https://lemire.me/blog/2018/07/25/it-is-more-complicated-than-i-thought-mtune-march-in-gcc/)

2. If no flags are specified explicitly, GCC will usually automatically apply -mtune=generic -march=x86-64.
   Intel claims that there is a 17% - 22% improvement when the march and mtune flags are set properly, 
   and not just generic,x86-64 or nocona is used.
